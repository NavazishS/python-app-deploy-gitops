# Reasoning and Justifications for System Design

This document provides reasoning and justifications for the choice of technologies and the overall system design used to deploy "The Responding Dark Laughter" (TRDL) web service. The selected technologies include Python for building the application, Jenkins for CI/CD, Minikube for local Kubernetes cluster, and ArgoCD for deployment.

## Technology Choices

### Python for Application Development

**Reasoning:**
Python is a widely-used programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and extensive libraries. It is suitable for building web services like TRDL due to its rapid development capabilities and strong community support.

### Jenkins for CI/CD

**Reasoning:**
Jenkins is a popular open-source automation server that offers robust CI/CD capabilities. We chose Jenkins to automate the build, test, and deployment processes because of its flexibility, wide range of plugins, and integration with various tools.

### Minikube for Local Kubernetes Cluster

**Reasoning:**
Minikube provides a lightweight,cost saving and convenient way to set up a local Kubernetes cluster for development and testing. It allows us to replicate a Kubernetes environment locally, enabling faster iteration and debugging of deployment configurations.

### ArgoCD for Deployment

**Reasoning:**
ArgoCD is a GitOps continuous delivery tool that automates the deployment of applications to Kubernetes. We selected ArgoCD for its GUI, declarative approach to deployment, synchronization with Git repositories, and ability to manage application state using GitOps principles.

## System Design

### High Availability and Uptime

**Justification:**
The requirement for a high availability system with strict uptime (multiple "9"s) is critical for ensuring a reliable service. By leveraging Kubernetes, we can design the application to scale horizontally and recover from failures, contributing to higher availability.

### Public Cloud Infrastructure

**Justification:**
Utilizing a public cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS) offers scalability, availability, and managed services that align with the high availability and production-level requirements of the system. It allows us to take advantage of cloud resources and services while minimizing operational overhead.

### Container Orchestration with Kubernetes

**Justification:**
Kubernetes provides powerful orchestration capabilities for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications. It enables efficient resource utilization, automated scaling, self-healing, and simplified management of the application's lifecycle.

### GitOps Deployment Model

**Justification:**
The GitOps deployment model aligns with modern practices for managing Kubernetes applications. ArgoCD, as a GitOps tool, helps maintain a declarative and version-controlled representation of the desired state of the application, making it easier to track changes, ensure consistency, and automate deployments.

## Conclusion

The chosen technologies and system design aim to meet the requirements of a high availability system for TRDL. The combination of Python, Jenkins, Minikube, and ArgoCD ensures a streamlined development and deployment process while adhering to best practices for scalability, reliability, and automation.
